# COMATH
A platform that has been developed to help students who want to get into the IT field to boost their knowledge in computer science and mathematics.
Problem CoMath is trying to solve
•	In our country Cameroon and in most secondary schools computer science teachers are inadequate which has led to poor grades. And an A grade in computer science is very scarce. CoMath stands to bridge that gap and provide qualified teachers to help students.
•	Another very terrifying problem is in the area of mathematics, many students turn to the term mathematics as a ‘nightmare’ this is mainly because they lack good teachers for the domain.
•	Unlike YouTube, or google we offer personalized learning as students receive quizzes from teachers 
•	Spaced Learning: Some students can’t retain a very large amount of information in a very short period. But with our platform, you learn at your own pace.
•	And in general, CoMath is focused on the two main branches of Engineering and Technology which is a vital domain in the world today. CoMath brings Courses which will teach students how to become better IT personnel.
Project Objectives
•	To create a user-friendly platform whereby, students can learn Mathematics and Computer Science.
•	These Courses are uploaded by teachers in the domain.
•	Students can create an account. Teachers are also able to create accounts.
•	Before a teacher is accepted to put content on the system he or she has to provide their CV and other necessary certificates.
•	Pricing of Courses is done by CoMath administrators. Students are required to pay to access courses.
•	Students can get messages (Emails) from teachers and provide feedback.
•	Quizzes are given by tutors.
KEY TECHNOLOGIES
•	HTML was used for the structuring of web pages.
•	CSS was used for styling the pages
•	Javascript was used to add interactivity between web pages.
•	React.js was used for the front to group pages into reusable components which can be easily integrated with node.js
•	Node.js was used for the backend
•	AWS was used to add other functionalities to our website.
•	MongoDB was used as the database.
AWS SERVICES USED
